Portfolio showing projects Ndumiso Biyela has worked on
## Project 1: Preidictive Maintanance
- Created a machine learning model to predict breakdown of machine using data from previous breakdowns.
- Perfomed exploratory data analysis on dataset to understand the datasets and detect null values and outliers.
- Perfomed data pre-processing by removing null values, outliers and correlated features.
- Built different machine learning models(Logistic Regression,Random Forest, Linear SVM, RBF SVM) and evaluated their perfomance.
- Perfomed hypertuning on parameters to find the best suitable parameters.
